## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In terms of survival, water is essential in human life. Water allows regulating the nutrients to cells, oxygen to the brain, allows the body to assimilate and absorb minerals such as vitamins, amino acids, and glucose. Water helps to discard the toxic waste of the human body, and it also helps to regulate body temperature. The lack of access to at least three gallons of water supply in three days will result in fatal disorder in body function, which will likely cause death. Moreover, water is used in various ways in human life, such as watering plants or livestock. While plants have more tolerance for water quality, humans and livestock can be significantly affected by the water quality since it can cause various health diseases caused by multiple sources such as parasites or pH of water. Some examples of diseases caused by poor water quality are cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

In this dataset, the water quality will be described from ten perspectives; pH, Hardness, Solid, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, Potability. Each of them represents the pH in water, the capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L, total dissolved solids in ppm, the amount of Chloramines in ppm, the Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L, the electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm, the amount of organic carbon in ppm, the number of Trihalomethanes in μg/L, The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state and indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable. In data, there are ten columns and 3276 rows provided by CC0: Public Domain. As it is shown in columns of the data set, the water quality was collected from 3276 different water bodies.
