Since 2008, cryptocurrency was treated more seriously after the great hit of bitcoin. The first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto, who mentioned that the problem of conventional currency is based on the trust that is needed to activate it. He mentioned that the central bank should be able to maintain the value of the conventional currency. Still, the history of conventional currency is tilted with the violation of that trust. The main identity of bitcoin was defined as an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Even though bitcoin was invented seven years ago, the full activation of bitcoin was started in 2016. Therefore, the bitcoin market is still in its infancy, and in the long run, the bitcoin market is still increasing. This indicates that cryptocurrency provides an alternative to currency depreciation, and it is much convenient and flexible than gold or silver to prepare for currency depreciation.

Despite its seriousness and market size, dogecoin is an exciting cryptocurrency to be held. As it can be seen in its name, dogecoin was named after the meme 'Shibe doge' and was introduced to satirize the increasing mark of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. Therefore, dogecoin was operated for experimentation reasons and for amusement. This perspective of dogecoin can be seen as a developer of meme 'Shibe doge' getting a donation from dogecoin, and customers can buy doge mask with dogecoin with 10% discount. However, after Elon Musk shows continuous interest in dogecoin, the value of dogecoin dramatically increased, and dogecoin quickly obtained the same line with other decent cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The more interesting thing about dogecoin is that the value fluctuating of dogecoin is far more dramatic. It is more dependent on technical improvement, investment attraction, and the Twitter of Elon Musk. For example, about the value fluctuating of dogecoin, the value of dogecoin was dramatically increased in 2021/5/5 and dramatically decreased a day after.
